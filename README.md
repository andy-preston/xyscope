# XYScope

*[UNFINISHED] vue.js component to display an
X-Y-Scope for data visualisation.*

I'm applying for a job that requires me to have a personal project
using Vue.js

Hot having a clue what to do... I tend to rely on *customers*
to specify projects. ;) ... I thought displaying a Lorenz attractor
might be an interesting training project... Only to discover that there
isn't really a plot component that'll do what I need it to do. So now that's
here.

As it stands... there's nothing here for you right now... move along...
But I'm my dreamland this is going to be a general purpose oscilloscope
component for React and Vue... let's see how it develops.
